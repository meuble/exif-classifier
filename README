EXIF-CLASSIFIER
===============

Simple ruby script, read all pictures from a directory,
then create a new directory tree using the exif.

Default is:

root/year/month/date.ext

Requirement: exifr (sudo gem install exifr)

This script is dedicated to Lyne, my goddaugther born
this morning (20100725).
I wish you a life full of luck, love and passions :)
